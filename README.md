Description
------------
Jones is a very basic work in progress rule engine used to learn more about basic AI concepts. 

Jones uses libnyx generic functions, so you need to install it first (https://github.com/picoflamingo/nyx)

It does not do much yet. Check doc/cmdline.txt  for some examples


*Note that the file extension is omitted. Command above loads file test.py*



Check doc/cmdline.txt for details
